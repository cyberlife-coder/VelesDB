# Changelog — velesdb-memory

All notable changes to the `velesdb-memory` crate are documented here. This
crate is versioned independently of the VelesDB workspace (0.x cadence) and is
released on its own `velesdb-memory-vX.Y.Z` tag.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First release of the local-first MCP memory server for AI agents.

### Added
- Five MCP tools over stdio mapping onto VelesDB's in-core Agent Memory SDK:
  `remember`, `recall`, `relate`, `forget`, and `why` (vector recall + multi-hop
  graph traversal — the connected-subgraph differentiator).
- Pluggable embeddings: a deterministic, offline `HashEmbedder` by default and an
  optional on-device `OllamaEmbedder` (`--features ollama`).
- Structured metadata (ColumnStore facet) with exact-match filtering on `recall`
  and `why`.
- Input guards (max fact size, capped recall limit and hop depth) and clean
  MCP error-code mapping: client-input errors map to `invalid_params`, faults to
  `internal_error`. `relate` validates both endpoints exist up front, so an
  unknown id is reported as `invalid_params` (not an internal fault) and the
  graph never gains an edge dangling off an unstored memory.
- License boundary by construction: memory semantics only, never raw database
  capabilities.
