# Changelog — velesdb-memory

All notable changes to the `velesdb-memory` crate are documented here. This
crate is versioned independently of the VelesDB workspace (0.x cadence) and is
released on its own `velesdb-memory-vX.Y.Z` tag.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Media fragments (experimental, PR1/3 of US-009 in EPIC-P-071)** —
  `ContextFragment.media: Option<MediaRef>` lets a fragment carry an inline
  base64-encoded image (`mime` + `bytes_b64`) alongside its text/caption
  `content`. A media fragment packs as one atomic, unsplittable piece (never
  chunked mid-image), is deduplicated on its *raw decoded bytes* (never the
  caption text, and never near-duplicated), and its token cost comes from a
  new dependency-free `ImageTokenEstimator` (PNG/JPEG header dimensions,
  `ceil(width * height / 750)`; unsupported mimes or unreadable headers fall
  back to a safe text-based over-count). Capped at 4 MiB of base64
  (`limits::MAX_MEDIA_BYTES`), separate from the existing per-fragment text
  cap; malformed base64 is rejected at validation time. PR1 ships no binary
  retrieval store: a media fragment that cannot fit the budget is `drop`ped
  with an explicit reason (`drop.media_unavailable`) rather than handed a
  `ctx://source` handle that would not resolve — externalized-media storage,
  screenshot expiry, and the Node/WASM/wire surface land in a later PR. Wire-
  compatible: `media` is `#[serde(default)]`, so every existing request still
  deserializes unchanged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Richer MCP tool descriptions and parameter docs for `relate` and `forget`
  (when to use them, directionality, examples, durability) — improves the
  schema quality MCP clients and directories surface.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`format_dated_context` / `DatedContext` (new `dated_context` module)** —
  formats recalled facts into a chronological, "now"-anchored timeline for dated
  recall; the primitive behind `recall_fused`'s `date_field` (MCP/Python) and
  `recallFusedDated` (Node/WASM/TypeScript SDK). (#1315, #1316)
- **Node binding `recallFusedDated`** — fused recall returning the dated timeline
  plus a `now` anchor in a single call. (#1316)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Fused vector+graph recall (`recall_fused` / `recall_fused_reranked`)**:
  vector recall combined with the graph reach `why()` walks, re-ranked with
  the entity-idf weighting validated on HotpotQA/TimeQA/LoCoMo. Exposed on
  the Node binding as `recallFused` (with `{hops, graphBoost, pool}` options,
  all DoS-clamped). Optional second-stage re-ranking via a bring-your-own
  `Reranker`.
- **Every recall path now includes the fact's caller-supplied metadata
  (`Recollection.metadata`)** — `recall`, `recall_where`, and `recall_fused`
  alike — enabling dated/chronological recall recipes (see
  `docs/guides/TEMPORAL_MEMORY.md`). Reserved system keys are never exposed.
- **Pluggable storage backend (`MemoryStore` trait)**: the wedge
  orchestration is now generic over its storage, with the native file-backed
  engine as the default `NativeStore` (existing callers see no change) and
  `velesdb-wasm` providing an in-memory backend so the full wedge runs in
  the browser. `persistence` becomes an optional, default-on feature.
- New `MemoryError::RollbackFailed` variant: a `remember` whose edge write
  failed after the fact was stored AND whose compensating delete also failed
  now reports both errors instead of silently keeping the fact.

### Fixed

- `recall_fused`'s metadata `filter` is enforced on graph-reached facts, not
  just the vector seed — a fact outside the caller's scope (e.g. another
  tenant) can no longer leak in through a graph connection.
- Score normalisation no longer sign-inverts a negative (in-range Cosine)
  vector score into an unbounded magnitude that dwarfed the whole ranking.
- The fused pool depth is DoS-clamped at the crate level (the default
  `k × 8` was previously unbounded), and metadata lookups across
  `recall`/`recall_fused` are batched into single storage round trips.
- An empty-but-present filter (`{}` at a JS boundary) now behaves exactly
  like no filter: entity hubs stay excluded from `recall`, `why`, and
  `recall_fused`; `recall_where` with no predicates routes through `recall`.
- `remember` validates all link input (targets AND relation labels) before
  any write, and rolls back a freshly-created fact if an edge write fails —
  a failed call can no longer overwrite a pre-existing fact's metadata or
  arm a TTL on a permanent memory.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-30

### Security

- **Upgraded `rmcp` 1.8.0 → 2.0.0**, which patches three advisories: OAuth token
  spoofing, SSRF via crafted MCP URLs, and a session-id leak in error responses.
  No code changes were needed — the MCP server/macros API stayed compatible.

### Fixed

- **`truncate()` UTF-8 panic** (extract error previews): the budget is now checked
  *before* appending a word, dropping the post-hoc `String::truncate` that could
  panic when the 120-byte limit fell mid-multibyte-character.
- **Dead code in `validate_relation`**: removed the redundant `is_ascii()` guard
  (`char::is_ascii_control()` is already `false` for non-ASCII code points).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Durable TTL on `remember`.** Facts can now expire. `remember` (MCP tool) and
  `MemoryService::remember_with_ttl` take an optional `ttl_seconds`; the expiry is
  persisted with the fact (`_veles_expires_at`), so it survives a restart, and
  expired facts stop being recalled. Metadata and a TTL combine. Set a server-wide
  default with `VELESDB_MEMORY_DEFAULT_TTL` (seconds); `0` means permanent. The
  Node binding's `remember` gains the matching `ttlSeconds` argument.

### Fixed

- **Cleaner MCP tool schemas.** Stripped `schemars`' non-standard integer `format`
  keywords (`uint64`/`uint`) from the generated tool schemas, so strict MCP clients
  no longer log `unknown format "uint64" ignored` for every id field.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

Benchmark milestone: the tri-engine is no longer just *wired* — each leg is
*measured* to beat pure-vector retrieval on its specialty, generation-free, on
public/real data, and the engines are shown to compound.

### Added
- **Generation-free retrieval benchmarks** isolating each engine's contribution,
  reproducible from bundled examples (`examples/{multihop,timeqa,colfilter,triengine}`):
  - **Graph (`why()` BFS) — multi-hop supporting-fact recall.** On **HotpotQA**
    (3 000 dev, distractor) fused vector+graph lifts supporting-fact recall
    **+3.3pp** overall and **+5.6pp** on retrieving *both* bridge facts, with an
    idf-weighted bridge that suppresses the flooding a naive boost causes. The
    win **replicates on a second independent dataset, 2WikiMultiHopQA**,
    concentrated on the genuinely multi-hop question types.
  - **ColumnStore (`recall_where` numeric range) — time-scoped recall.** On real
    **TimeQA** Wikipedia bios, the year-range predicate lifts gold-sentence recall
    **+9.7pp** (+18.6pp on a controlled synthetic pilot) where cosine alone cannot
    disambiguate candidates that differ only by a number.
  - **Tri-engine compounding capstone** (`examples/triengine`): on a task that is
    multi-hop *and* time-scoped at once, Graph and ColumnStore together lift recall
    more than the sum of their individual gains — the engines stack.
- **LoCoMo harness** (`examples/locomo/`) extended into a tuning/diagnostic
  workbench: retrieval-only and explanation modes, per-category diagnostics, BM25
  baseline, idf-weighted graph fusion, date-context/date-routing and a temporal
  scaffold, an optional Claude judge/generator, and a configurable evidence budget.
- Positioning and benchmark write-ups (`POSITIONING.md`, `BENCHMARK.md`) grounding
  every claim in a reproducible measurement, with each engine's honest limit
  disclosed.

### Notes
- No public API change — this release adds benchmarks, examples and documentation
  around the existing `MemoryService` / MCP surface introduced in 0.1.0.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First release of the local-first MCP memory server for AI agents.

### Added
- MCP tools over stdio mapping onto VelesDB's in-core Agent Memory SDK:
  `remember`, `recall`, `recall_where` (fused vector + ColumnStore range/filter
  recall), `relate`, `forget`, `why` (vector recall + multi-hop graph traversal —
  the connected-subgraph differentiator), and `remember_extracted` (auto text →
  fact↔topic graph via an `Extractor`).
- The same high-level `MemoryService` is consumed beyond the MCP server by the
  Python binding (`velesdb-python`) and the Node.js binding (`velesdb-node` /
  `@wiscale/velesdb-memory-node`); the library is feature-gated (`default-features
  = false` drops the rmcp/tokio MCP stack) so bindings link a lean core.
- `recall_where` activates a secondary bitmap-prefilter index on first use, so
  filtered recall stays flat as the collection grows (instead of an O(n) scan).
- Pluggable embeddings: a deterministic, offline `HashEmbedder` by default and an
  optional on-device `OllamaEmbedder` (`--features ollama`).
- Structured metadata (ColumnStore facet) with exact-match filtering on `recall`
  and `why`.
- Input guards (max fact size, capped recall limit and hop depth) and clean
  MCP error-code mapping: client-input errors map to `invalid_params`, faults to
  `internal_error`. `relate` validates both endpoints exist up front, so an
  unknown id is reported as `invalid_params` (not an internal fault) and the
  graph never gains an edge dangling off an unstored memory.
- License boundary by construction: memory semantics only, never raw database
  capabilities.
