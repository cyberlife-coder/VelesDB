# Test Document for VelesDB RAG Demo

This is a test document to verify that the RAG demo properly loads existing documents from VelesDB when the application starts.

## Key Features to Test:

1. **Document Persistence**: Documents should remain in VelesDB after server restart
2. **Loading Existing Documents**: The interface should show existing documents on startup
3. **Document Deletion**: Users should be able to delete individual documents

## Technical Details:

- This document contains multiple sections
- Each section has different content for testing semantic search
- The RAG system should be able to find relevant passages

## Sample Questions for Testing:

- "What is this document about?"
- "What features should be tested?"
- "How does document persistence work?"

This content will be chunked and embedded into VelesDB for vector search testing.
