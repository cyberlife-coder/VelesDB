# Phase 5 Plan 04: Website Claims Audit & Final Quality Gates

## Objective

Audit all "marketing" claims in README.md — website card descriptions, impact stories, ROI tables, and comparison claims. Ensure every claim is either backed by working code/benchmarks or clearly labeled as aspirational. Final quality gates pass before committing.

## Context

**Requirements addressed:** VP-009 (Website/screenshot claims audit)
**Phase goal contribution:** This is the final pass — after this plan, every claim in the README is truthful and verifiable. The "zero false advertising" constraint is fully met.

**⚠️ Post-Phase 8 revision (2026-02-09):**
- Phase 8 resolved GAP-1 (JOIN), GAP-2 (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT), GAP-3 (/query/explain)
- README already had parser-only labels removed and `/query/explain` added to API table
- FEATURE_TRUTH.md updated for JOIN/compound/explain
- Final consistency pass must now also verify FEATURE_TRUTH.md alignment
- VelesQL feature set is significantly broader post-Phase 8 — marketing claims have stronger backing

**Website card claims to audit (from README):**
- "Agentic Memory" — does VelesDB actually implement agent memory systems?
- "GraphRAG" — does the MATCH + similarity pattern deliver GraphRAG?
- "AI Desktop Apps" — Tauri plugin exists and works?
- "Browser Vector Search" — WASM module works?
- "Mobile AI" — Mobile crate exists?
- "On-Premises" — Single binary, no cloud dependency?
- "Multi-Agent Collaboration" — Is this implemented or planned?

**Impact stories to audit:**
- Healthcare Diagnostics (line 1184-1200): "0.6ms diagnosis suggestions" — verifiable?
- Manufacturing QC (line 1202-1216): MATCH syntax error already fixed in Plan 03

**Comparison claims:**
- "100x faster locally" vs cloud (line 46)
- "700x faster search" vs pgvector (line 159)
- "15MB binary" (lines 48, 77, 1124)
- "Zero dependencies" (line 77)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Website Card Claims Against Actual Capabilities

**Files:** `README.md`

**Action:**
Review each capability claim and classify:

1. **"Vector + Graph + Columns"** (line 67):
   - ✅ All three stores exist and are queryable via VelesQL
   - Verified by Phase 4 E2E tests
   - **Verdict: ACCURATE**

2. **"18.7ns SIMD" / "57µs HNSW"** (line 71-72):
   - Verified in Plan 05-02
   - **Verdict: Depends on 05-02 reconciliation**

3. **"15MB Binary"** (line 77):
   - Verify: `cargo build --release -p velesdb-server` and check binary size
   - If actual size differs significantly, update claim
   - **Action: Verify and update if needed**

4. **"Run Anywhere — Server, Browser, Mobile, Desktop"** (line 79):
   - Server: velesdb-server ✅
   - Browser: velesdb-wasm ✅
   - Mobile: velesdb-mobile ✅
   - Desktop: tauri-plugin-velesdb ✅
   - **Verdict: ACCURATE (crates exist)**

5. **"Zero dependencies"** (line 77):
   - This is misleading — velesdb-core has many Cargo dependencies
   - What it means: zero *runtime* dependencies for the end user (single binary)
   - **Action: Clarify wording to "Zero runtime dependencies" or "Single binary, no external services"**

6. **"100% Ecosystem Complete"** (header line 15):
   - All SDK crates exist ✅
   - But are they all *published* to registries? If not, the claim is premature
   - **Action: Verify registry publication or change to "Full Ecosystem"**

7. **Use Cases table** (lines 197-208):
   - "32x memory compression" for Mobile — refers to binary quantization
   - Verify this number matches quantization docs
   - **Action: Cross-reference with quantization section**

**Verify:**
```powershell
# Check release binary size
cargo build --release -p velesdb-server 2>$null
$size = (Get-Item "target/release/velesdb-server.exe").Length / 1MB
"Server binary: $([math]::Round($size, 1)) MB"
```

**Done when:**
- Each website claim classified as ACCURATE, NEEDS_UPDATE, or MISLEADING
- Misleading claims clarified with accurate wording
- Binary size claim verified

---

### Task 2: Audit Impact Stories and ROI Tables

**Files:** `README.md`

**Action:**
Review each ROI/impact claim for plausibility:

1. **ROI Table** (lines 51-58):
   - "70% less code" — reasonable claim for replacing 3 DBs with 1
   - "$500-5000/mo → $0" — valid for local-first
   - "100-300ms → < 1ms" — verified by benchmarks (57µs search)
   - "3x faster shipping" — subjective but reasonable
   - **Verdict: Claims are reasonable, keep as-is**

2. **Comparison Table** (lines 154-161):
   - "100x faster locally" vs Pinecone — 57µs vs ~5-50ms cloud = ~100-1000x ✅
   - "Single binary (15MB vs 100MB+)" vs Qdrant — verify Qdrant size claim
   - "700x faster search" vs pgvector — this is a bold claim, needs source
   - **Action: Add footnote or source for "700x faster" claim, or soften to "orders of magnitude faster"**

3. **Business Scenario Impact Tables** (lines 645-650, 670-675, 695-700, 721-726):
   - "350ms → 2ms" for E-commerce — plausible with subquery overhead
   - "2-5 seconds → < 10ms" for Fraud Detection — plausible
   - "500ms+ → < 5ms" for Healthcare — plausible
   - "100-200ms → < 1ms" for AI Agent Memory — plausible with local storage
   - **Verdict: Plausible order-of-magnitude claims. Add "estimated" qualifier if not benchmarked**

4. **Healthcare Impact Story** (lines 1184-1200):
   - "0.6ms diagnosis suggestions" — no benchmark for this specific scenario
   - **Action: Add "estimated based on local HNSW search latency" or similar qualifier**

5. **Manufacturing QC** (lines 1202-1216):
   - MATCH syntax already fixed in Plan 05-03
   - "50% fewer defective shipments" — aspirational/hypothetical
   - **Action: Frame as hypothetical use case, not proven result**

**Verify:**
```powershell
Select-String -Path "README.md" -Pattern "700x|100x|50%.*fewer" | ForEach-Object { "$($_.LineNumber): $($_.Line.Trim())" }
```

**Done when:**
- Bold performance comparison claims have sources or are softened
- Impact stories clearly framed as illustrative/estimated
- No provably false claim remains

---

### Task 3: Final Consistency Pass & Quality Gates

**Files:** `README.md`, `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md`, `.planning/phases/v4-05-readme-documentation-truth/FEATURE_TRUTH.md`

**Action:**
1. **Final consistency scan across ALL three reference documents:**
   - Version references consistent
   - Feature status consistent between README, VELESQL_SPEC.md, and FEATURE_TRUTH.md
   - No contradictions between sections
   - Phase 8 changes (JOIN, compound, EXPLAIN) reflected consistently everywhere
   - GAPS.md shows GAP-1/2/3 as RESOLVED and remaining GAPs (4-9) accurately described

2. **Check all markdown links work:**
   ```powershell
   Select-String -Path "README.md" -Pattern "\]\(" | ForEach-Object {
       if ($_ -match '\]\(([^)]+)\)') {
           $path = $Matches[1]
           if ($path -notmatch "^http" -and $path -notmatch "^#") {
               if (-not (Test-Path $path)) { "❌ Broken: $path (line $($_.LineNumber))" }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run quality gates:**
   ```powershell
   cargo fmt --all --check
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
   Note: These are documentation-only changes, so code quality gates should still pass (no code modified).

4. **Final markdown lint:**
   - No broken tables
   - No unclosed code blocks
   - No orphaned HTML tags

5. **Verify README renders correctly** — check for any markdown issues introduced by edits in Plans 05-02 and 05-03

**Verify:**
```powershell
# Quality gates
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace 2>&1 | Select-String "test result"

# Broken links
Select-String -Path "README.md" -Pattern "\]\((?!http|#)([^)]+)\)" -AllMatches | ForEach-Object {
    $_.Matches | ForEach-Object { 
        $path = $_.Groups[1].Value
        if (-not (Test-Path $path)) { "❌ $path" }
    }
}
```

**Done when:**
- README and VELESQL_SPEC.md are internally consistent
- All relative links point to existing files
- Quality gates pass
- No markdown rendering issues

---

## Verification

After all tasks complete:

```powershell
# Full quality gates
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

# Final link check
Select-String -Path "README.md" -Pattern "\]\((?!http|#)([^)]+)\)" -AllMatches
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Every website card claim verified as accurate or corrected
- [ ] Binary size claim verified
- [ ] "Zero dependencies" clarified
- [ ] Bold comparison claims sourced or softened (700x, 100x)
- [ ] Impact stories framed as illustrative/estimated where not benchmarked
- [ ] README, VELESQL_SPEC.md, and FEATURE_TRUTH.md internally consistent
- [ ] Phase 8 changes (JOIN, compound, EXPLAIN) reflected consistently across all docs
- [ ] GAPS.md accurately reflects resolved vs remaining gaps
- [ ] All relative links work
- [ ] Quality gates pass (fmt, clippy, test)
- [ ] No markdown rendering issues

## Parallel Safety

**Exclusive write files:** `README.md` (final pass — marketing claims, impact stories)
**Shared read files:** `docs/VELESQL_SPEC.md`, `.planning/phases/v4-05-readme-documentation-truth/FEATURE_TRUTH.md`, `.planning/phases/v4-05-readme-documentation-truth/GAPS.md`, benchmark files
**Conflicts with:** Plan 05-03 (must run AFTER 05-03)

## Output

**Files modified:**
- `README.md` — Corrected marketing claims, added qualifiers, verified links
