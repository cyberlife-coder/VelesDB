## Honest Assessment

| Category | Count | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| ✅ **FIXED** | 12 | Real bugs corrected with code changes |
| 🔶 **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** | 8 | Suboptimal but functional - tracked for v2.0 |
| ✔️ **JUSTIFIED DESIGN** | 18 | Correct architecture with solid reasoning |
| 📝 **DOCUMENTED** | 13 | Behavior documented, user can make informed choice |

## ✅ FIXED (12) - Real Code Changes

| Flag | Problem | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| Weighted fusion hardcoded | Server ignores client weights | Added avg/max/hit_weight params to DTO |
| REST field mismatch | Client sends fusion, server expects strategy | Aligned client to server API |
| Graph empty without label | Silent empty list confusing | Returns 400 with clear message |
| LangChain hash collision | hash() can collide | int(id) first, hash fallback with warning |
| LangChain filter API | Wrong method called | Use search_with_filter() |
| WASM createIndex silent | No error on unsupported | Throws Error (fail-fast) |
| Python BFS unwrap_or(0) | ID 0 could be valid | filter_map skips empty |
| ORDER BY multi-similarity | Only first column used | HashMap stores per-column scores |
| NaN comparison panic | partial_cmp panics on NaN | total_cmp() for safety |
| PropertyIndex truncation | u64→u32 silent truncation | try_from + reject with warning |
| Duration overflow | u128→u64 truncation | .min(u64::MAX) protection |
| LatencyHistogram caps | Same overflow issue | Protected with min() |

## 🔶 NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (8) - Tracked for v2.0

| Flag | Current State | Why Not Fixed Now | v2.0 Plan |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **GraphService isolation** | In-memory, not persisted | Major architecture change | EPIC-004 integration |
| **LabelTable panic** | assert! at 4B labels | Ergonomic API, 4B unrealistic | Return Result |
| **Index no versioning** | No schema migration | Indexes can be rebuilt | Add version field |
| **WASM similarity duplication** | Logic duplicated from core | WASM isolation needed | Extract shared module |
| **QueryPlanner TODO** | Cost-based optimization missing | Performance adequate | Implement planner |
| **Grammar no negative floats** | Only negative integers | Rare use case | Add grammar rule |
| **10x over-fetch hardcoded** | Fixed multiplier | Works for most cases | Make configurable |
| **Edge removal cleanup order** | Index may be stale during op | Final state consistent | Atomic operation |

## ✔️ JUSTIFIED DESIGN (18) - Correct Architecture

### Memory/Performance Trade-offs (5)
| Flag | Trade-off | Justification |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| HashSet→HashMap 8B/edge | +Memory for O(1) removal | Graph deletions are frequent |
| Cross-shard duplication | +Memory for O(1) lookup | Read-heavy workload |
| ConcurrentEdgeStore write lock | Blocking during remove | Consistency > concurrency |
| EdgeStore saturating_mul | Clamp extreme values | Defensive programming |
| Integer log2 | Avoids float imprecision | Mathematically correct |

### API Semantics (7)
| Flag | Behavior | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| filter_by_similarity inversion | Double-invert for distance | User expects "higher = more similar" |
| ORDER BY similarity first column | Populates .score field | Standard SQL-like behavior |
| Asymmetric OR | SQL OR semantics | Matches SQL expectations |
| RoaringBitmap u32 limit | Reject > 4B with warning | Library constraint, sufficient capacity |
| compare_json arrays/objects equal | No natural ordering | Complex types incomparable |
| Metric-aware sort direction | Lower distance = first | Natural user expectation |
| BfsIterator pending_results | Buffer fixes edge-skipping | Correctness > memory |

### Architecture (6)
| Flag | Pattern | Justification |
|------|---------|---------------|
| GraphService per-collection | Isolation per tenant | Multi-tenancy requirement |
| Server separate states | Preview feature pattern | Clean separation |
| Index graceful degradation | Warning + empty index | Data preserved, availability > consistency |
| GPU tests serial | Prevent wgpu deadlocks | Hardware constraint |
| Null payload unified | Consistent handling | Predictable behavior |
| Clippy -W not -D | Warn, don't block | DX for contributors |

## 📝 DOCUMENTED (13) - Behavior Explained

| Flag | Behavior | Documentation |
|------|----------|---------------|

| 10x over-fetch documented | ANN limitation | API docs |
| TypeScript error handling | Defensive fallbacks | Robust, not a problem |
